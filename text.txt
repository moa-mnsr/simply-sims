Welcome to my blog about Sims. 

As a pre-teen in the early 2000s, I was an extremely avid Sims player (Sims 1, mostly, and then briefly, Sims 2 - for a short period in which I believe I borrowed from my slightly older and much edgier teen neighbor - who was mostly psyched about the sex). 

In the first era of my sim-a-thons, I used cheats to get money and build the best houses (rosebud rosebud rosebud), dreaming about adult life without the hustle (of which I knew so little), recreating episodes of 'Friends' on my own PC, and above all, coordinating romances and affairs among my sims (of which I knew even less).
        
My mother reports that around the time that she believes the fourth expansion pack came out, I acquired it immediately, and played obsessively for about two weeks. Then came a three day period where I disappeared into my bedroom and Simmed unstoppably for at least eight hours a day. On the third day, I came downstairs, and suddenly said, 'I'm done. I have a problem.' And never played Sims again.

-- until November 2020, when I had a dream I was playing the Sims, then found it IRL as abandonware -- and the looking glass lured me down the rabbit hole again...
